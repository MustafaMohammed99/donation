## summary of project
The Online Donations Management and Monitoring Project is a system designed to facilitate and organize online fundraising efforts. It features a dashboard that caters to multiple user types, including administrators and charitable organizations.

Administrators have the authority to create accounts for charitable organizations and oversee the projects they propose. They can accept or reject donation projects initiated by these organizations and track their progress by reviewing reports and statistics.

Charitable organizations, on the other hand, can create specific fundraising projects, outlining their objectives, donation purposes, and target amounts. They have the flexibility to manage and update their projects while monitoring the donations received.

Regular users of the system are individuals interested in contributing to various donation initiatives. They can view the different projects proposed by charitable organizations and easily make secure donations.

In essence, the Online Donations Management and Monitoring Project aims to simplify and streamline the process of charitable fundraising, ensuring systematic oversight and efficiency through its multi-user system and integrated dashboard powered by the Laravel framework.
